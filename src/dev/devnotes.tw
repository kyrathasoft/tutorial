# added a <a target="_new" href="https://bryanmiller.us/2025/05/javascript-speech-functions">couple</a> of speech functions to setup object

__Notes for 5/26/2025__ 
# I'm off work for Memorial Day 2025

# The hint gives the combination for the keypad in passage {{{HoloCombo}}}
# installed Gargoyle interpreter and the ADRIFT-5 game-maker and runner
# added JS functions setup.ThreeVisits() and setup.HasLink()
# developed a couple <a target="_new" href="https://gist.github.com/kyrathasoft/f30c7143dcfae30cb48025a56b4c327c">functions</a>


__Notes for 5/24/2025__ 
# I can't seem to figure out why some item pairings in {{{UsageResult}}} aren't working
# as a workaround, I'm having to add code to widget {{{ItemUseFailed}}}
# imped combine leather gunbelt and mesh belt: it exchanges one worn belt for the other
# I've tested canteen with other objects, leather gunbelt with other objects
# added desc to widget in {{{MyWidgets}}} for a bundle of cloth strips
# added message to IncrementScore when wetting handkerchief
# permit saving in {{{EscapeFrom}}} but don't point it out to player unless time runs out
# it's now possible to cut the bundled cloth strips; wasteful, but possible

__Notes for 5/23/2025__ 
# added widget for combining repaired drone and water from canteen
# added a time limit in psg {{{EscapeFrom}}}
# if above time limit reached, moves action along to {{{HoloCombo}}}
# added <a target="_new" href="https://gist.github.com/kyrathasoft/5409f4df3340d87f0c914274b5cc3a5d">code</a> in JS section to handle local and remote assets
# tracked down elusive bug involved with the canteen/capsule combo
# I'm not sure why, but use sludge->myself fails, so I had to add code to {{{<<ItemUseFailed>>}}}

__Notes for 5/22/2025__ 
# added code so that when drone cut with knife, becomes a tiny ball of micro-fine wire 
# added code so that upon being cut, drone no longer shows up in inventory or as a room item
# removed 'salvage' as action available in {{{EscapeFrom}}}
# implemented custom msg when you try to use knife->a tiny ball of micro-fine wires
# added {{{$droneSalvaged}}} to {{{StoryInit}}} with false value
# added {{{$droneSalvaged}}} to {{{PsgCheckVars}}}
# added interaction between knife and holographic interface; chooses 1 of 3 responses randomly

__Notes for 5/21/2025__ 
# do I want to make it possible to sever the drone with the KaBar?
# If so, would that have same effect as 'salvage'-> drone
# I have implemented knife->drone (whether crushed or repaired)
# decided we don't really need the 'salvage' option
# now that I've imped examine, combine, use, we need situations/locations that make use of these items

__ Notes from 5/20/2025__ 
# yesterday I got all canteen interactions sorted
# replaced all text for canteen/myself with widget {{{<<CanteenAndMe>>}}}, for code re-use
# combining canteen/flashlight using either 'use' or 'combine' uses widget {{{<<CanteenAndFlashlight>>}}}
# combining canteen/KaBar now handled with widget {{{<<CanteenAndKaBar>>}}}
# combining canteen/handkerchief now handled using 'use' or 'combine' via {{{<<WetHankie>>}}} widget
# modified widget {{{<<WetRevolver>>}}} to show one of four sentences
# tweaked widget {{{<<WearMetallicCloak>>}}} so call to {{{<<IncrementScore>>}}} makes a Dialog unnecessary
# expanded on widget {{{<<widget WearDampHandkerchief>>}}} so it randomly picks one of two responses
# no more cases in {{{ComboResult}}} or {{{UsageREsult}}} for which I haven't created a resuable widget
# implemented cutting handkerchief (dry or damp) into cloth strips
# discovered I'd imped knife->myself but not myself->knife; fixed
# note that 'combine' knife-> or self-knife foreshadows what happens if 'use' knife-myself & reverse
# found I'd failed to implement 'use' metallic belt -> knife
# found I'd failed to implement 'combine' gray capsule -> knife

__Notes from 5/19/2025__ 
# In {{{UsageResult}}}, replaced two duplicate text blocks with widget {{{<<WetHankie>>}}}
# In {{{UsageResult}}}, replaced two duplicate text blocks with widget {{{<<HealingSludge>>}}}
# In {{{UsageResult}}}, replaced two duplicate text blocks with widget {{{<<DonCloak>>}}}
# In {{{ComboResult}}}, replaced text desc with widget {{{<<CanteenPlusCapsule>>}}} in two places
# In {{{UsageResult}}}, replaced text desc with widget {{{<<CanteenPlusCapsule>>}}} in two places
# I now have damp hankie and metallic cloak showing (worn) where/when appropriate
# installed TADS and read <a target="_new" href="https://www.tads.org/t3doc/doc/t3QuickStart.htm#documentation">here</a> down to No. 2
# using canteen with all other {{{EscapeFrom}}} room/inv items generate sensical responses
# refactored desc for canteen/revolver & vice-versa to {{{<<WetRevolver>>}}}
# used the above line's widget twice each in {{{ComboResult}}} and {{{UsageResult}}}
# so, I think canteen mated with all other objects in inventory and {{{EscapeFrom}}} is working...
# widget {{{<<KnifeAndGunBelt>>}}} serves four instances of combining gunbelt/knife across two passages
# combining gunbelt/revolver now gives one of four random responses


__Notes from 5/18/2025__ 
# set up plumbing for using one item on another while trapped in initial chamber in the UFO
# implemented using objects on self in the initial UFO room
# implemented result of applying sludge (canteen + capsule) to myself
# the above implementation includes healing injury and removing remaining sludge from inventory
# I've now implemented 'use canteen' on 'metallic mesh belt', and 'belt' on 'canteen'
# I've now implemented 'combine canteen' with 'metallic mesh belt' and vice versa
# In all four of the above cases, we call <a target="_new" href="https://gist.github.com/kyrathasoft/c017f9db0e4271b8c15602f2b7532762">widget</a> {{{<<CombineMeshBeltWithCanteen>>}}}
# Implemented combine canteen/drone and drone/canteen
# Implemented use canteen/drone and drone/canteen
# sorted a bug in {{{ComboResult}}} caused by a missing {{{<</switch>>}}}
# you can now combine myself/KaBar and vice versa
# you can now use myself/Kabar and vice versa

__Notes from 5/17/2025__ 
# finished {{{EscapeFrom}}} items being combined with water from your canteen
# tweaked {{{<<widget ItemComboFailed>>}}} to give a better phrased response when your canteen is involved
# I think I've exhausted item combinations
# I think I can save myself work by getting rid of 'drop' and 'take' (just make them implicit/automatic) {next line}
# that'll leave only 'salvage' and 'use' to be implemented

__Notes from 5/16/2025__ 
# got Score incrementing working
# got two item combos working that produce 1) wet hankie and 2) a small spot of gray sludge
# somewhere around 1200 words added in the past forty-eight hours (14th-16th of May 2025)

__Notes from 5/15/2025__ 
# got plumbing installed for combining two items while "in" passage {{{EscapeFrom}}}
# I still need to code a passage to describe the result of item combination and that (next line)
# removes the 'combined' items and replaces them with the resulting item

__Notes from 5/14/2025__ 
# decided not to try to do EVERYTHING in passage {{{EscapeFrom}}}
# moved examining objects into <a target="_new" href="https://gist.github.com/kyrathasoft/78b695415571e188ea898a9f4791b2fa">passage</a> {{{EscapeFromExamine}}}

# used a widget, {{{<<<<ShowNonEmptyInventoryWhileInPsgEscapeFrom>>>>}}}, to factor 3 lines of $ts from {{{EscapeFrom}}}
# factored-out into a <a target="_new" href="https://gist.github.com/kyrathasoft/11d3f2e7dfb4320ddb10a4b07cc07098">widget</a> the 19-line $ts to show {{{EscapeFrom}}} room items
# updated {{{StoryInit}}} so that {{{EscapeFrom}}} can make use of {{{$escape.door_material}}}.
# <a target="_new" href="https://gist.github.com/kyrathasoft/375ca562aa6119853716ab7f5e05554d">v6</a> of {{{EscapeFrom}}} uses a {{{<<switch>>}}} that tests {{{$escape.current_verb}}}
