/* Campfire passage for tutorial lesson 9 */

<<= setup.Title>><<set _brief to Setting.getValue("brevity")>>

You sit before a cheerful campfire<<if not _brief>>, the crackling flames hypnotic, the warmth from the blaze soothing the cares from your knotted muscles<</if>>.

To the [[east|Cliff]], the ridge <<if not _brief>>on which you're camped<</if>> rises to an abrupt cliff<<if not _brief>> overlooking a river<</if>>.

The<<if not _brief>> mossy<</if>> knoll <<if not _brief>>on which your campfire is located<</if>> slopes gradually downhill to the [[southwest->SkeletonHollow]]<<if not _brief>>, leading to a copse of firs and evergreens<</if>>.

<<if $cupsOfCoffeeDrank eq 0>>
	You yawn. <<if not _brief>>As much as you enjoy camping out, you never sleep as 
    well in a tent as you do in your bed. <</if>><<if not _brief>>Through a mental fog, you<<else>>You<</if>> 
    	<<if $instantCoffeePackets gt 0>> realize that you have some instant coffee 
        	in your backpack &mdash; which is in your [[tent->YourTent]].<<else>>berate yourself 
        	for using up all your instant coffee yesterday. 
        	You could really use some right now.
